	Purpose: Create a more flexible table layout that's not constrained by <td>

	Rationale:
	Some clients don't support being able to make table cells block elements with display: block;
	hence an alternative approach should be taken to create a column layout for mobile optimisation
	Using floated tables with the align method allows you to do this and is more flexible.

	Because Outlook lacks a sane box model, the "ghost column" method is applied
	to actually make Outlook render the code as two table cells.

					<td>Column #1 Content</td>

			<!--[if mso]></td><td><![endif]-->
			<!-- Column 2 -->
			<table align="left">
				<tr>
					<td>Column #2 Content</td>
