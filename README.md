HTML Email Boilerplate Redux
==============================================

A HTML Email Boilerplate is designed to create a solid foundation for any email campaign by fixing various email client quirks from the beginning (saving headaches later!), as well as providing a good starting point for building your own email campaigns/templates.

There are various email boilerplate templates around, however Central College Nottingham has adapted its own boilerplate template based on a variety of sources as well our own additions based on our own research and development. We regularly review changes in email client behaviour and aim to keep our boilerplate constantly up to date with the latest developments and changes in the email world.

We refer to our email boilerplate as a redux of the [original HTML Email Boilerplate](http://htmlemailboilerplate.com/)

## What does our redux version of the HTML email boilerplate include?

As well as creating a solid foundation for any email campaign, our boilerplate also focuses on the following areas:

* Forcing the document mode (Edge) for Internet Explorer based clients
* CSS3 support in the native mail client on Windows Phone 8 and above (POP3/IMAP)
* Scaling images correctly in Outlook when using DPI scaling factors greater than 96 DPI
* Improved Windows Phone compatibility
* Improved Office 365 (OWA) compatibility

As well as fixing other email client quirks that have been discovered.

## Usage:

Our boilerplate is split into two versions, stable and experimental. There are two variants of the stable boilerplate and one variant of the experimental boilerplate.

* [Stable with guidelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centralcollegenottingham/html-email-boilerplate-redux/master/htmlemail-boilerplate-stable-with-guidelines.html) - Commented version for guideline purposes
* [Stable without guidelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centralcollegenottingham/html-email-boilerplate-redux/master/htmlemail-boilerplate-stable-without-guidelines.html) - Version to use in live email campaigns
* [Experimental without guidelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centralcollegenottingham/html-email-boilerplate-redux/master/htmlemail-boilerplate-experimental-without-guidelines.html) - Bleeding edge version to test new developments

### Stable

The two variants of the stable boilerplate are essentially the same, the main difference is one features lots of comments for guideline purposes (with guidelines), while the other is simply the same document but without any HTML/CSS comments (without guidelines), which is the version you should use in your own email campaigns.

**Never use the guidelines version in a live email campaign, as HTML/CSS comments play havoc with spam filters and even cause emails to appear blank in a few clients!**

### Experimental

The experimental version of the boilerplate is essentially a bleeding edge test ground. As things change in the email client world, new code needs to be tested. This version provides a perfect base for this without disrupting the stability and original purpose of the stable boilerplate.

New code that hasn't been tested thoroughly will appear on the experimental version first. If the newly added code passes our own QA tests it will eventually make its way to the stable version. Sometimes if experimental code doesn't pass such tests, it will just be removed entirely without going near the stable version.

**It is strongly recommended that you NEVER use the experimental version of the boilerplate in a live email campaign. The experimental version may not have been tested thoroughly and hence its cross email client compatibility is not guaranteed. Always use the stable version!**
